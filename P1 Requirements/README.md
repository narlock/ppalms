# P1: Requirements and Use-cases

## FOCUS
- You are required to turn in the requirements document and your use-cases. You can put your use-cases as a chapter in your requirements document, or you can submit it as a separate document. 
- For Deliverable 1, focus on organization, ensuring that you have all needed sections, and demonstrating that you can write good requirements. Completing the document and writing test cases will be the focus of a later project deliverable. 

## Given Task
Your task in this assignment is to develop use-cases for the PPALMS, generate requirements from those use-cases and the elicitation session with the user, and write a requirements document as your deliverable. You may choose any organization of your document, but always keep in mind that it must be readable, changeable, and capture all the essential information we have discussed in class—remember, you will design and implement this later, and, if you have a poor requirements document, you will run into problems; you will be partially graded on what the system ought to do (as opposed to what you think it should do). 

## Information on PPALMS
Here you will get a set of informal “user requests” of what this system shall do. Note that this is purposely incomplete and vague, and the assignment is to sort it all out. This will evolve as the project progresses. 

- Users: Instructors, researchers, TAs

### The system shall… 
- allow instructors to select source code for inclusion.
- allow instructors to annotate specific lines for inclusion/exclusion.
- allow instructors to form and order line tuples.
- allow instructors to select the question type (i.e. matching, ordering, multiple-choice, etc.).
- generate all possible variations of the source code which match the question type.
- allow the user to select the intended LMS target.
- create an appropriate output file for inclusion in the selected LMS.
- Allow for potential reuse of problems.
