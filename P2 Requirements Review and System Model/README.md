Now that you have specified requirements for the PPALMS system, you will conduct a requirements review exercise and analyze the requirements to create system models to show its context, structure and interactions.

There are two components that are to be included in this deliverable.

A requirements review report along with an updated systems requirement document
Conceptual model of the system that shows the system's context, structure and interactions
For the requirements review, you will as a team develop a checklist of questions to help guide the review. ([Here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/CSC340F/2005/assignments/inspections/reqts_checklist.pdf) Links to an external site.is an example from Prof. Steve Easterbrook that you can use to fashion yours so that you address the five categories we discussed in class). Then as a team you should review the requirements document using the questions as a guide and summarize your findings in a review report.  You will then update the requirements document to address the review findings.  At a minimum the checklist must have questions for each of the five kinds of checks discussed in class.


For the conceptual model of the system, you will develop at least three different kinds of models that we will discuss in the upcoming class (these are in Chapter 5 of the textbook).  Each model should have a graphical representation along with a narrative explanation to help the reader understand the model.  You may organize these models in a single separate document in some reasonable fashion or include these models under Appendix B in your updated SRS document.
