## Project Description

[Parson’s problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsons_problems) are a form of assessment which differ from the typical code writing form of question on a typical exam in an introductory computer science class. Rather than “Write me a program that does x, y, and z,” students are asked to rearrange lines of code with the prompt “The following should do x, y, and z, but does not. Rearrange the lines of code (or remove any which are not to be used) so that the resulting code completes the task” or something similar. These problems serve a number of functions, but specifically, our research at University of Minnesota Software Engineering Center is focusing on how we can use these problems to better prepare students for industry.
