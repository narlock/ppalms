## Project Description

[Parson’s problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsons_problems) are a form of assessment which differ from the typical code writing form of question on a typical exam in an introductory computer science class. Rather than “Write me a program that does x, y, and z,” students are asked to rearrange lines of code with the prompt “The following should do x, y, and z, but does not. Rearrange the lines of code (or remove any which are not to be used) so that the resulting code completes the task” or something similar. These problems serve a number of functions, but specifically, our research at University of Minnesota Software Engineering Center is focusing on how we can use these problems to better prepare students for industry.

## Task

Your mission, should you choose not to fail the project, is to document the solution’s requirements and provide the design for a stand-alone system, which we will from here on call PPALMS (Parson’s Problems Appliance for Learning Management Systems). You will in the later stages of the project deliver the first couple of working versions of PPALMS with some minimal functionality.

In essence, the system should:
- Allow users to select a piece of source code from their machine
- Enable a variety of mechanisms for annotating the source code for problem creation
- Allow the user to select from a variety of types of Parson’s problems
- Generate as many variations as possible of the selected type from the provided source
- Collect the generated questions for import into Learning Management Systems
